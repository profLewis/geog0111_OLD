    "- **Part 1: Data Preparation**\n",
    "  \n",
    "     The first task you must complete is to produce a dataset of the proportion of HUC catchment 13010001 (Rio Grande headwaters in Colorado, USA) that is covered by snow for **two years** (not necessarily consecutive), along with associated datasets on temperature (in C) and river discharge at the Del Norte monitoring station. You will use these data in the modelling work in Part 2 of the coursework.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     You **may not** use data from the years 2005 or 2006, as this will be given to you in illustrations of the material.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The dataset you produce must have a value for **the mean snow cover, temperature and discharge in the catchment for every day over each year.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Your write up **must** include fully labelled graph(s) of snow cover, temperature and discharge for the catchment for each year (with units as appropriate), along with some summary statistics (e.g. mean or median, minimum, maximum, and the timing of these). \n",
    "    \n",
    "    You **must** provide evidence of how you got these data (i.e. the code and commands you ran to produce the data).\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Checklist:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * provide fully commented/documented code for all operations.\n",
    "    * provide two years of **daily** data (not 2005 or 2006)\n",
    "    * Generate datasets of:\n",
    "        * mean snow cover (0.0 to 1.0) for the catchment for each day of the year\n",
    "        * temperature (C) at the Del Norte monitoring station for each day of the year\n",
    "        * river discharge at the Del Norte monitoring station for each day of the year\n",
    "    * Produce a table of summary statistics for each of the 3 datasets (one for easch year)\n",
    "    * produce graphs of the 3 datasets for each year (as function of day of year)\n",
    "    * produce an `npz` file containing the 3 datasets, one for each year.\n",
    "    * produce images of snow cover spatial data for the catchment for **13 samples** spaced equally through the year, one set of images for each year. You need to do this for the data pre-interpolation and aftyer you have done the interpolation.\n",

    "The first task involves pulling datasets from different sources. No individual part of that should be too difficult, but you must put this together from the material we have done so far. It is more a question of organisation then.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps think first about where you want to end up with on this (the 'output'). This might for example be a dictionary with keys `temp`, `doy`, `snow` and `flow`, where each of these would be an array with 365 values (or 366 in a leap year).\n",

    "Then consider the datasets you have: these are: (i) a stack of MODIS data with daily observations; (ii) temperature data in a file; (iii) flow data in a file.\n",

Again, we read the datasets in, trying to make this efficient on data size by only using the area of the vector data mask as in a previous exercise. The data reading will be very similar to reading the MODIS LAI product, but you need to work out and implement what changes are necessary. As advised abovem you should use the `raster_mask2()` function for creating the spatial data masks.

One reason for that is that often the best way to learn something like this is to find an example that someone else has written and adapt that to your purposes.

If there was no original input other than vbolting pieces of existing code together though, you be unlikely to achieve more than a pass.
