    "While Python has a rich set of modules and data types by default, for numerical computing you'll be using two main libraries that conform the backbone of the [Python scientific stack](https://scipy.org/about.html). These libraries implement a great deal of functionality related to mathematical operations and efficient computations on large data volumes. These libraries are [`numpy`](http://numpy.org) and [`scipy`](http://scipy.org). `numpy` deals with efficient arrays, similar to lists, that simplify many common processing operations. Of course, just doing calculations isn't much fun if you can't plot some results. To do this, we use the [`matplotlib`](http://matplotlib.org) library.\n",

You could have an array an array that stores the values of a measured magnitude every hour for a whole year, which you would store in an e.g. `24 x 365` array. If you wanted to find out the mean hourly value over the year, you'd have to average the 365 data points per hour, or if the array is called `a`, you could do `a.mean(axis=1)`, which will return a 24 element 1D array with the average value over the year in each element."
