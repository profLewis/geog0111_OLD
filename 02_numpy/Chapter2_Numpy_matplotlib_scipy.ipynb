    "While Python has a rich set of modules and data types by default, for numerical computing you'll be using two main libraries that conform the backbone of the [Python scientific stack](https://scipy.org/about.html). These libraries implement a great deal of functionality related to mathematical operations and efficient computations on large data volumes. These libraries are [`numpy`](http://numpy.org) and [`scipy`](http://scipy.org). `numpy` deals with efficient arrays, similar to lists, that simplify many common processing operations. Of course, just doing calculations isn't much fun if you can't plot some results. To do this, we use the [`matplotlib`](http://matplotlib.org) library.\n",

The big advantages of `numpy` are that you can easily perform array operators (such as adding two arrays together), and that `numpy` has a large number of useful functions for manipulating N-dimensional data in array form. This makes it particularly appropriate for raster geospatial data processing.\n",

It does pretty much all you need in terms of 2D plots, and simple 3D plots, and is fairly straightforward to use. Have a look at the [matplotlib gallery](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/index.html) for a fairly comprehensive list of examples of what the library can do as well as the code that was used in the examples.\n",

You could have an array an array that stores the values of a measured magnitude every hour for a whole year, which you would store in an e.g. `24 x 365` array. If you wanted to find out the mean hourly value over the year, you'd have to average the 365 data points per hour, or if the array is called `a`, you could do `a.mean(axis=1)`, which will return a 24 element 1D array with the average value over the year in each element."

    "Similar to lists, you can refer to elements in the array by their position. You can also use the `:` symbol to specify a range (a **slice**) of positions `first_element:(last_element+1`. If you want to start counting from the end of the array, use negative numbers: `-1` refers to the last element of the array, `-2` the one before last and so on. In a slice, you can also specify a step as the third element in `first_element:(last_element+1:step`. If the step is negative you count from the back.\n",

The most common data interchange format is [CSV (comma-seperated values)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values), a plain text format. Think of CSV as a plain text table. Each element in each row is separated by a comma (although other symbols, such as white space, semicolons `;`, tabs `\\t` or pipe `|` symbols are often found as delimiters). The first few lines might contain some metadata that describes the dataset, and the first line will also contain the names of the headers of the different columns.  Lines starting with `#` tend to be ignored. An example file might look like this\n",
