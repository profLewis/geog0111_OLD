    "While Python has a rich set of modules and data types by default, for numerical computing you'll be using two main libraries that conform the backbone of the [Python scientific stack](https://scipy.org/about.html). These libraries implement a great deal of functionality related to mathematical operations and efficient computations on large data volumes. These libraries are [`numpy`](http://numpy.org) and [`scipy`](http://scipy.org). `numpy` deals with efficient arrays, similar to lists, that simplify many common processing operations. Of course, just doing calculations isn't much fun if you can't plot some results. To do this, we use the [`matplotlib`](http://matplotlib.org) library.\n",

Each element in each row is separated by a comma (although other symbols, such as white space, semicolons `;`, tabs `\\t` or pipe `|` symbols are often found as delimiters). The first few lines might contain some metadata that describes the dataset, and the first line will also contain the names of the headers of the different columns.
